"Population Analysis task 1" 
Project Overview this projct examine population data and utilizes visualization such as bar chart and histogram to ighlisght trends and key insights by representing the data graghycally,it simplifies the process of identifying demographic patterns over time 
My Project Motivation was to understand population trends is essential for making informed decisions in various fields such as economics, urban planning, and policy-making. This project provides clear visualizations that help interpret demographic changes effectively.
Features of this project are:                                            1.Loads and processes population data efficiently. 2.Generates bar charts and histograms for analysis.3.Customizable visualization settings for better insights     
Population data sourced from the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/).
One challenge was handling missing data in population records. By utilizing Pandas data preprocessing techniques, the dataset was cleaned, ensuring accurate visual representations.
